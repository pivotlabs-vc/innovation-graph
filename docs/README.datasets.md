# Datasets

## Pivot Labs innovation scraping

The following datasets are derived from scraping UK gov websits:

- `data/challenges/dasa`: Innovation challenges from the DASA website with
  topic extraction.
- `data/challenges/ktn`: Innovation challenges scraped from the website with
  topic extraction.
- `data/challenges/ktnie`: Innovation challenges scraped from the website with
  topic extraction.
- `data/challenges/ncsc`: Innovation challenges scraped from the website with
  topic extraction.
- `data/challenges/ukri`: Innovation challenges scraped from the website with
  topic extraction.

A very naive topic extractor is in use, the topics may not be particularly
useful at the moment.
