## Pivot Labs innovation scraping

The following datasets are derived from scraping UK gov websits:

- (`data/challenges/dasa`)[../data/challenges/dasa]:
  Innovation challenges from the DASA website with topic extraction.
- (`data/challenges/ktn`)[../data/challenges/ktn]:
  Innovation challenges scraped from the website with topic extraction.
- (`data/challenges/ktnie`)[../data/challenges/ktnie]:
  Innovation challenges scraped from the website with topic extraction.
- (`data/challenges/ncsc`)[../data/challenges/ncsc]:
  Innovation challenges scraped from the website with topic extraction.
- (`data/challenges/ukri`)[../data/challenges/ukri]:
  Innovation challenges scraped from the website with topic extraction.

A very naive topic extractor is in use, the topics may not be particularly
useful at the moment.

## UKRI organogram

At (`data/ukri-organogram`)[../data/ukri-organogram].  
This is the organogram for UKRI, published by ONS.

This captures relationships between science advisory teams and the
government departments with which they work.  The data set was provided
by a UK government rep at a graph collabotion event.
